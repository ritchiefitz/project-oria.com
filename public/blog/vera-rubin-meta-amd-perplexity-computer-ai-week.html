      <p class="article-excerpt">Nvidia unveils the Vera Rubin AI system with 10x efficiency gains, Meta commits $100B to AMD chips for personal superintelligence, and Perplexity launches Computer—a multi-agent system that orchestrates rival AI models like a team of specialists.</p>

    <div class="article-content">
      <p>This week delivered three stories that each, on their own, would have dominated any normal news cycle. Nvidia revealed its next-generation AI supercomputing platform. Meta signed the largest chip procurement deal in history. And Perplexity shipped a product that treats competing AI models as interchangeable workers on the same team. Together, they paint a picture of an industry entering its most capital-intensive and architecturally ambitious phase yet.</p>

      <h2>Nvidia's Vera Rubin: 10x More Efficient Than Blackwell</h2>

      <p>Nvidia pulled back the curtain on Vera Rubin, the successor to its Grace Blackwell architecture and the company's most ambitious AI system to date. The headline claim: <strong>10 times more performance per watt</strong> than its predecessor. If that number holds under real-world workloads, it represents a generational leap in the economics of AI training and inference.</p>

      <p>Vera Rubin is not just a GPU upgrade. It's a full-stack system redesign—new chips, new interconnects, new memory architecture—all engineered to push the frontier of what a single rack of hardware can accomplish. The system is scheduled to begin rolling out later this year, with Meta already confirming plans to deploy Vera Rubin in its data centers by 2027.</p>

      <p>The customer list reads like a who's who of frontier AI: OpenAI, Anthropic, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft are all expected buyers. This matters because it signals that the hyperscalers aren't slowing down their infrastructure buildout—they're accelerating it. Nvidia's fiscal year 2026 revenue hit $215.9 billion, up 65% year-over-year, and Vera Rubin is positioned to keep that trajectory climbing.</p>

      <blockquote>
        "The efficiency gains in Vera Rubin don't just improve performance—they fundamentally change the cost equation for training frontier models."
      </blockquote>

      <p>The timing is strategic. DeepSeek is preparing to release its V4 and R2 models, expanding context windows to 1 million tokens and reportedly giving domestic Chinese chip suppliers like Huawei early optimization access over Nvidia and AMD. Vera Rubin is Nvidia's answer: make the hardware so good that switching away becomes economically irrational.</p>

      <h2>Meta's $100 Billion AMD Bet on Personal Superintelligence</h2>

      <p>Meta announced a multiyear agreement to purchase up to <strong>$100 billion worth of AMD chips</strong>, including MI540 GPUs and CPUs. The stated purpose: diversifying its AI infrastructure to support the development of what Meta is calling "personal superintelligence."</p>

      <p>This is extraordinary for several reasons. First, the scale. A hundred billion dollars in chip procurement from a single vendor dwarfs anything the industry has seen before. For context, the entire global semiconductor market was around $580 billion in 2024. Meta is committing roughly 17% of that figure to AMD alone.</p>

      <p>Second, the strategic intent. By splitting its AI infrastructure between Nvidia and AMD, Meta reduces its dependence on any single supplier while creating competitive pressure that benefits its negotiating position. This is a playbook borrowed from cloud computing, where multivendor strategies have become the norm.</p>

      <p>Third, the framing. "Personal superintelligence" is an ambitious—some might say audacious—goal. Meta appears to be building toward AI systems that serve individual users with superhuman capability across a wide range of tasks. Whether that vision is three years away or ten, the infrastructure investment is happening now.</p>

      <p>This deal also lands in the same week that OpenAI signed a <strong>$10 billion+ contract with Cerebras Systems</strong> for 750 megawatts of computing power over three years. The message from the industry is clear: the companies building frontier AI believe they need vastly more compute than currently exists, and they're willing to commit staggering sums to secure it.</p>

      <h2>Perplexity's "Computer": AI Models as Interchangeable Workers</h2>

      <p>While Nvidia and Meta are pouring money into infrastructure, Perplexity is rethinking the software layer with a product called <strong>Computer</strong>. The concept is deceptively simple: treat multiple AI models—Claude Opus 4.6, Gemini, ChatGPT 5.2, Grok, and others—like specialized employees on a shared team.</p>

      <p>Computer breaks complex tasks into sub-agents, each running in parallel with access to a real browser, filesystem, and tool integrations. These agents can operate for hours or even months on sustained tasks. It's not just multi-model orchestration—it's a fundamental rethinking of how AI systems should be composed.</p>

      <p>The implications are significant:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Model commoditization:</strong> If a system can dynamically route work to whichever model performs best for a given subtask, individual model capabilities matter less than the orchestration layer.</li>
        <li><strong>Long-running agents:</strong> Moving beyond single-turn interactions to agents that maintain state and work autonomously over extended periods represents a qualitative shift in what AI systems can accomplish.</li>
        <li><strong>Competitive dynamics:</strong> Perplexity is positioning itself as the operating system layer above the foundation models, capturing value without needing to train its own frontier model.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>This comes as the Agentic AI Foundation (AAIF), housed in the Linux Foundation, reports 97 Gold and Silver members in its first quarter—more than doubling early CNCF membership growth. The industry is clearly converging on agentic AI as the next major paradigm.</p>

      <h2>The Bigger Picture</h2>

      <p>Step back and the pattern is unmistakable. The AI industry is simultaneously scaling up (Nvidia's Vera Rubin, Meta's $100B AMD deal, OpenAI's Cerebras contract) and scaling out (Perplexity's multi-agent orchestration, the Agentic AI Foundation's rapid growth). Hardware is getting dramatically more efficient. Software is getting dramatically more composable. And the capital flowing into both is unprecedented.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, the effects of AI are becoming more visible in everyday products. Airbnb's AI assistant now resolves a third of customer support issues before a human agent gets involved. LinkedIn has abandoned traditional SEO metrics entirely, pivoting to visibility within AI-generated responses. Microsoft is warning about new AI prompt injection attack vectors that manipulate chatbot memory through URL parameters.</p>

      <p>We're watching the infrastructure for the next era of computing being built in real time. The question isn't whether AI will transform how we work and live—it's whether the pace of change will give institutions time to adapt. Based on this week's news, the answer seems to be: probably not.</p>

      <h2>What to Watch Next Week</h2>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>DeepSeek V4 and R2 developments:</strong> Any release timeline updates could reshape the competitive landscape, especially regarding Huawei's early optimization access.</li>
        <li><strong>Vera Rubin benchmark results:</strong> Independent validation of Nvidia's 10x efficiency claims will be closely scrutinized.</li>
        <li><strong>EU AI Act implementation:</strong> Transparency rules approaching their August 2026 deadline continue to shape how companies deploy AI in Europe.</li>
        <li><strong>Earnings season:</strong> CrowdStrike (Mar 3) and Marvell Technology (Mar 5) report, offering insight into AI-driven cybersecurity and networking chip demand.</li>
      </ul>
