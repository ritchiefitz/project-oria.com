    <div class="article-content">
      <p>The <strong>Humanoids Summit</strong> returned to the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, California on December 11–12, 2025【450362266976375†L66-L75】.  More than 2,000 people — including robotics engineers from Disney, Google and dozens of startups — gathered to showcase humanoid robots and debate what it will take to make them useful【58784182889014†L154-L157】.  The commercial boom in artificial intelligence has reignited interest in humanoids as the next big platform, but the summit highlighted both dazzling progress and persistent skepticism【58784182889014†L159-L169】.</p>

      <h2>An AI‑fuelled robotics boom</h2>
      <p>Organizer Modar Alaoui noted that many researchers now believe humanoid robots or some other physical embodiment of AI “are going to become the norm,” though the timeline remains uncertain【58784182889014†L159-L163】.  Generative AI chatbots like OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini have not only attracted investors to robotics but also improved robot perception and planning.  Visual‑language models train robots to understand their surroundings and learn tasks【58784182889014†L197-L205】, complementing advances in computer vision and hardware.</p>
      <p>Investor enthusiasm is already translating into capital: McKinsey researchers count about 50 companies worldwide that have each raised at least $100 million to develop humanoids.  Roughly 20 of those companies are based in China and 15 in North America【58784182889014†L185-L188】.  China’s lead is driven in part by government incentives for component production and robot adoption, including a mandate to build a complete humanoid ecosystem by 2025【58784182889014†L189-L194】.  At the Silicon Valley summit, Chinese firms — particularly Unitree — dominated the expo floor because their relatively inexpensive platforms are widely used by researchers【58784182889014†L189-L195】.</p>

      <h2>Big names and real deployments</h2>
      <p>Much of the early attention has gone to demonstrations.  Disney showed off a fully walking, animatronic version of <em>Frozen</em>’s Olaf that will roam Disneyland parks in Hong Kong and Paris next year【58784182889014†L164-L169】.  The robot balances on its own and interacts with guests, offering a glimpse of how entertainment companies can use humanoids to tell stories.</p>
      <p>Beyond showpieces, some companies are beginning to put humanoids to work.  Oregon‑based Agility Robotics announced a commercial agreement with Mercado Libre on December 10, 2025: its <strong>Digit</strong> robot will join a fulfillment center in San Antonio, Texas【413277210473539†L45-L57】.  The agreement envisions Digit handling repetitive, physically taxing tasks to reduce labor gaps and improve ergonomics【413277210473539†L59-L63】.  Agility says Digit is already the first humanoid robot commercially deployed in industrial settings; the human‑sized machine can walk, lift and move totes through existing warehouse aisles【413277210473539†L75-L80】.  Such deployments suggest that humanoids may gain traction first in logistics and manufacturing rather than in homes.</p>

      <h2>Skepticism and challenges</h2>
      <p>Despite the hype, experts caution that general‑purpose humanoids remain a long way off.  Cosima du Pasquier, founder of Haptica Robotics, told attendees that “the humanoid space has a very, very big hill to climb” because giving robots a reliable sense of touch and dexterity requires fundamental research【58784182889014†L176-L178】.  Robotics pioneer Rodney Brooks, co‑founder of iRobot, wrote earlier this year that today’s humanoids will not learn how to be truly dexterous despite hundreds of millions of dollars in investment【58784182889014†L207-L211】.  His skepticism, widely cited at the summit, underscores that advanced manipulation, energy efficiency and cost‑effective manufacturing are unsolved problems.</p>
      <p>Even as investors pour money into ambitious startups, industrial robots performing single tasks still outmatch humanoids in speed and precision【58784182889014†L234-L236】.  The path to general‑purpose robots will likely involve incremental improvements to grasping, balance, perception and battery life — and novel business models that justify the cost.</p>

      <h2>What comes next?</h2>
      <p>The summit made clear that the race to build humanoids is global, with China currently ahead on manufacturing momentum and the United States strong in AI expertise【58784182889014†L238-L246】.  Industry leaders such as Jeff Burnstein, president of the Association for Advancing Automation, argue that the U.S. needs a national strategy for robotics to keep pace【58784182889014†L238-L246】.  Meanwhile, real‑world pilots like Agility’s Digit show that narrowly targeted humanoid applications can deliver value today, even if the dream of a household robot remains distant.</p>
      <p>For now, the Humanoids Summit serves as a barometer of both progress and patience.  As Modar Alaoui observed, humanoids may indeed “become the norm,” but turning prototypes into reliable workers will require breakthroughs in materials science, AI, and economics.  Watching how the field navigates those challenges in the coming years will determine whether 2025 marks the start of a humanoid revolution or just a burst of enthusiasm.</p>
