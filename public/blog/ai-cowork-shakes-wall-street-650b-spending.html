      <p class="article-excerpt">Anthropic's Claude Cowork platform triggers a software stock selloff, Big Tech commits a staggering $650 billion to AI infrastructure, and world models emerge as the next frontier in artificial intelligence.</p>

    <div class="article-content">
      <p>This has been one of the most consequential weeks in AI since the original ChatGPT launch. Anthropic's enterprise AI platform sent shockwaves through financial markets, the four largest tech companies revealed jaw-dropping infrastructure spending plans, and the race to build AI systems that understand the physical world accelerated dramatically. Here's what happened and why it matters.</p>

      <h2>Claude Cowork Triggers a Software Stock Rout</h2>
      <p>The week's biggest story started with Anthropic. The company unveiled new plugins for Claude Cowork, an AI-powered workplace assistant capable of authoring documents, organizing files, and adapting to specialized sectors like legal, finance, and data marketing. Investors immediately saw the writing on the wall for incumbent software companies.</p>

      <p>The market reaction was swift and brutal. Thomson Reuters and LegalZoom each fell more than 15% on Tuesday. RELX, the parent company of LexisNexis, and FactSet Research also suffered double-digit drops. Even enterprise giants like Salesforce and Workday took significant hits. The WisdomTree Cloud Computing Fund has now plummeted roughly 20% year-to-date, including a 6.5% drop this week alone.</p>

      <p>Then on Thursday, Anthropic announced Claude Opus 4.6, a new model specifically designed to enhance Cowork's capabilities for office and coding work. The company claims the model outperforms OpenAI's GPT-5.2 on benchmarks evaluating knowledge work in finance and legal fields, intensifying fears that AI-native tools could replace specialized enterprise software packages entirely.</p>

      <p>This pattern echoes what happened when DeepSeek shook markets in January, but with an important difference: instead of undermining the case for AI infrastructure spending, Cowork is undermining the case for the software that runs on top of it. The disruption is moving up the stack.</p>

      <h2>$650 Billion: Big Tech's Unprecedented AI Bet</h2>
      <p>While software stocks cratered, the infrastructure behind AI received the biggest capital commitment in technology history. According to Bloomberg, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft have collectively forecast capital expenditures reaching approximately $650 billion in 2026, nearly all of it earmarked for new data centers and the hardware within them.</p>

      <p>To put that in perspective, each company's 2026 estimate is expected to either near or surpass their budgets for the past three years combined. Bloomberg called it "a boom without a parallel this century."</p>

      <p>The spending spree is not slowing down. Amazon's earnings report this week revealed plans for $200 billion in 2026 capex, while Alphabet announced $175 to $185 billion in AI spending, roughly double its 2025 investment. Meta is planning $115 to $135 billion in AI capital expenditure. Meanwhile, Cerebras Systems closed a $1 billion Series H round and signed a $10 billion-plus deal with OpenAI to supply wafer-scale AI chips, offering an alternative to NVIDIA's dominance.</p>

      <p>The central question remains: will AI revenues eventually justify this investment? Skeptics point to the gap between spending and returns, while bulls argue that AI infrastructure is becoming as essential as electricity was in the early 20th century. Either way, the sheer scale of commitment makes it clear that the largest companies on Earth are betting their futures on AI.</p>

      <h2>World Models: AI Learns to Understand Physical Reality</h2>
      <p>Perhaps the most forward-looking development this week was the continued momentum behind world models, AI systems that learn how things move and interact in three-dimensional space. Google launched Project Genie, an AI world model that converts text prompts into playable interactive digital worlds, now available to AI Ultra subscribers. Video game stocks tumbled on the announcement.</p>

      <p>The world model race is heating up across the industry. Yann LeCun left Meta to start his own world model lab, reportedly seeking a $5 billion valuation. Fei-Fei Li's World Labs launched its first commercial world model, Marble. General Intuition scored a $134 million seed round, and Runway released GWM-1, its first world model.</p>

      <p>Google DeepMind also went on an acquisition spree, purchasing Common Sense Machines for its 2D-to-3D AI capabilities, striking a licensing deal with Hume AI to boost Gemini's voice and emotion technology, and partnering with Sakana AI for Japan-focused research. These moves collectively signal that the next major leap in AI may not come from making language models bigger, but from teaching AI to understand and simulate the physical world.</p>

      <h2>The Broader Picture</h2>
      <p>Several other developments rounded out an eventful week. OpenAI launched Prism, a LaTeX-native workspace for scientists, while announcing plans to retire GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, o4-mini, and GPT-5 variants on February 13, pushing users toward GPT-5.2. Apple and Google announced a multi-year deal to power next-generation Siri with Gemini. Mozilla introduced a one-click privacy tool in Firefox allowing users to opt out of AI training datasets.</p>

      <p>On the workforce front, the AI-driven transformation of employment continues to accelerate. Companies like Pinterest, Dow, HP, and Amazon have collectively cited AI in tens of thousands of recent layoffs. Employment for recent graduates in computer science and math has declined 8% since 2022, according to Oxford Economics.</p>

      <p>Regulatory activity is also intensifying. New York's RAISE Act was signed into law, Texas's TRAIGA became effective, and the EU's AI Act transparency rules are approaching their August 2026 enforcement date. The tension between rapid AI advancement and the pace of governance shows no signs of easing.</p>

      <h2>What It Means</h2>
      <p>This week crystallized a theme that has been building for months: AI is no longer disrupting from the edges. It is coming directly for the revenue streams of established software companies, demanding unprecedented infrastructure investment, and opening entirely new categories of technology with world models. The transition from AI as a novelty to AI as economic infrastructure is accelerating, and the market is pricing in both the enormous opportunity and the real disruption that comes with it.</p>
