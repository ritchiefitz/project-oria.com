      <p class="article-excerpt">Researchers have unveiled the Biological Interface System to Cortex (BISC), an
        ultra‑thin brain‑computer interface that uses a single silicon chip with tens of thousands of electrodes to
        wirelessly stream brain signals at 100 Mbps, creating a high‑bandwidth link between brains and AI.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="article-content">
      <p>Artificial intelligence and neurotechnology just took a giant leap forward. A team of engineers and
        neuroscientists from Columbia University, NewYork‑Presbyterian, Stanford University and the University of
        Pennsylvania have demonstrated a paper‑thin brain‑computer interface that can stream neural activity in real
        time. Known as the <em>Biological Interface System to Cortex</em> (BISC), the device shrinks an entire
        brain‑computer interface (BCI) onto a single, flexible silicon chip. Unlike today’s bulky implants, BISC slides
        gently between the skull and brain and creates a wireless, high‑bandwidth portal between neural circuits and
        external computers.</p>

      <h2>An ultra‑thin brain chip with thousands of electrodes</h2>
      <p>The breakthrough lies in miniaturization and integration. Traditional BCIs require multiple microelectronic
        components—amplifiers, data converters, radio transmitters and power circuits—housed in a canister implanted
        under the skull or chest. BISC instead packs everything onto a complementary metal‑oxide‑semiconductor chip that
        is just 50 µm thick and measures roughly 3 mm³. Despite its tiny footprint, the chip contains <strong>65,536
          electrodes</strong>, <strong>1,024 simultaneous recording channels</strong> and <strong>16,384 stimulation
          channels</strong>, allowing it to both listen to and stimulate neural activity with unprecedented
        resolution【152053196164404†L184-L191】.</p>
      <p>A wearable “relay station” powers the implant wirelessly and uses a custom ultrawide‑band radio to transfer
        data at 100 Mbps—<em>at least 100 times faster</em> than any wireless BCI built
        previously【152053196164404†L194-L200】. Because the relay station speaks Wi‑Fi, any computer can connect to the
        brain through the implant. The integrated circuits handle radio transmission, power management, digital control
        and data conversion on the chip itself, reducing the device to a flexible sheet that conforms to the brain’s
        surface【152053196164404†L184-L191】.</p>

      <h2>Transforming how AI reads and writes brain signals</h2>
      <p>High‑bandwidth BCIs are essential for advanced AI applications. Decoding complex intentions or perceptions
        requires streaming large amounts of neural data into machine‑learning models, while restoring movement or
        sensation demands precise stimulation patterns. By turning the cortical surface into a portal for
        <em>read–write</em> communication with AI, BISC enables algorithms to interpret brain signals and send
        information back in real time【152053196164404†L148-L151】. In early tests, researchers showed that the device can
        record fine‑grained neural activity while remaining stable inside the skull【713150020785456†L31-L37】. The
        integrated software environment provides an instruction set and machine‑learning toolkit so that developers can
        build adaptive neuroprosthetics and brain‑AI interfaces directly on the platform【152053196164404†L203-L207】.</p>

      <h2>Why it matters</h2>
      <p>This leap in brain‑computer interfacing has sweeping implications. The ultra‑thin implant could help treat
        drug‑resistant epilepsy, restore movement in people with paralysis and eventually aid those living with
        blindness or ALS【713150020785456†L31-L37】. Because the device is manufactured with semiconductor techniques, it
        can be produced at scale, moving BCIs from bespoke research gadgets to mass‑producible medical
        devices【152053196164404†L186-L191】. More broadly, BISC hints at a future where AI and human cognition are
        tightly coupled, enabling real‑time communication between brains and machines. Instead of decoding a few motor
        commands, next‑generation BCIs might stream rich perceptual experiences, thoughts and intentions, opening new
        frontiers in prosthetics, therapy and even human–machine collaboration.</p>

      <h2>Looking ahead</h2>
      <p>Clinical translation is already underway. Researchers have partnered with neurosurgeons to refine surgical
        techniques and plan trials for managing drug‑resistant epilepsy【152053196164404†L153-L166】. As the team
        continues to test and miniaturize the technology, the biggest questions involve ethical deployment, data privacy
        and equitable access. However, the core technical breakthrough—a tiny silicon chip that turns the cortex into a
        high‑speed, two‑way interface—marks a pivotal moment for neuroengineering and AI. For the first time, a single
        integrated circuit can stream thoughts.</p>
